Welcome to the capstone wiki!
FORMAL PROJECT APPROVAL:
Project Description
Create a journal and put in template pages that you can fill out and it will persist.
Bullet journals are both to-do lists as well as kind of a scrapbook/time capsule. Pages can be as simple as just a Notes page all the way to a calendar. Calendar will be a stretch goal. There are other form-type pages like what am I reading right now or what are my favorite movies right now. A lot of the emphasis will be on forms, templates, CSS, and smooth UI
